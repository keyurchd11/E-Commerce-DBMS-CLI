## Setup

1. You must have MySQL Server installed. To do so,
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```
When installing the MySQL server for the first time, you will be prompted for a root password with which you can later log in. If for some reason, you aren't asked for the password during installation, try prepending the start command with `sudo` and provide your root password. You can then set a root password or create a new user. 

To start MySQL, run
```bash
mysql -u <user_name> -p
```
You will then be prompted for the user's password.

If you wish to create a new user,
```sql
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
To grant access and modification privileges to this new user, run
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

2. Create a new database for the eCommerce website, using the following SQL command, and then set it up.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
USE <database_name>;
```

3. To initialise the database with the tables required, run 
```bash
source CREATE_TABLES.sql
```

4. Now, create a `.env` file in the project directory, and paste the following in it. Replace the "xxx"s with the appropriate details for the fields.
```
MYSQL_HOST="localhost"
MYSQL_USER="xxx"
MYSQL_PASSWORD="xxx"
MYSQL_DATABASE="xxx"
``` 

5. You will need to install the required modules to run the CLI. You can choose to create a virtual environment for this purpose. Note that this step is completely optional, and can be skipped.
```bash
python3 -m venv <venv_name>
source <venv_name>/bin/activate
```

6. Install the required modules within your virtual environment.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. Everything is now set up. To run the CLI,
```bash
python3 main.py
```

<b>Note: </b>To exit the virtual environment,
```bash
deactivate
```
